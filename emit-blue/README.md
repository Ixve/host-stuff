# emit.blue's leaked source code 
The public leaked source code of emit.blue from around August 14, 2021

This code was published in GitHub for a brief amount of time by Tactical Parrot (Emit.blue's dev) itself, and made it private short after. Someone was lucky enough to download it and share it to me. Two months later, I asked Tactical if I could reupload this in GitHub, to which he said yes.  
This code, however, has vulnerabilities which will **not** be corrected, due to the nature of this repo just being a reupload. If you want to continue developing it, feel free to fork it and do anything you want

Proof of him allowing me to share the code
